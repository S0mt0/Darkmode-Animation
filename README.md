# Darkmode-Animation
A simple animation with a glowing effect on dark-mode.

This is the original sourcecode to this page.
Here, every component of the page was built from scratch purely with HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript (for responsiveness with the button and and the animations)

The page consists basically of two main parts: the BOTTON and the main BODY.

Feel free to study the codes, suggest a better code solution, or even a much better and interesting animation effect.

PS: I'm new to coding, and so far I've been studying and experimenting. So this is one of my first attempts to working with CSS animation.
